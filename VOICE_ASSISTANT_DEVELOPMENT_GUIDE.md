    I -->|Yes| K[Commit Changes]
    J --> A
    E --> K
```

### 2. Adding New Features

When adding new voice assistant features:

1. **Write scenario test first**:

   ```python
   def test_new_feature_scenario(self):
       """Test new feature with realistic user story."""
       # Given: User wants to use new feature
       # When: Voice command is processed
       # Then: Expected behavior occurs
   ```

2. **Add unit tests for components**:

   ```python
   def test_new_feature_unit(self):
       """Test new feature implementation details."""
       # Test individual methods/classes
   ```

3. **Update integration tests**:

   ```python
   def test_new_feature_integration(self):
       """Test new feature with real services."""
       # Test with actual external APIs
   ```

4. **Verify coverage**:
   ```bash
   ./run_comprehensive_voice_tests.py --suite unit
   ```

### 3. Code Coverage Maintenance

#### Coverage Targets

- **Unit Tests**: 95% coverage
- **Scenario Tests**: 90% coverage
- **Integration Tests**: 85% coverage
- **Overall Target**: 90% coverage

#### Coverage Monitoring

The system automatically tracks coverage trends:

```python
# Check coverage trend
from tests.test_config import CoverageMonitor
monitor = CoverageMonitor()
print(monitor.get_coverage_report())
```

#### Handling Coverage Drops

If coverage drops below 90%:

1. **Identify missing tests**:

   ```bash
   ./run_comprehensive_voice_tests.py --suite unit --verbose
   ```

2. **Add targeted tests**:

   ```python
   def test_missing_error_path(self):
       """Test previously untested error handling."""
       # Focus on uncovered lines
   ```

3. **Review scenario coverage**:
   ```python
   from tests.test_config import TestScenarioManager
   manager = TestScenarioManager()
   print(manager.generate_scenario_report(completed_tests))
   ```

## 📊 Test Scenarios

### Core User Scenarios

#### 1. Quick Task Creation

```python
def test_quick_task_creation(self):
    """User: 'Call mom at 3pm' -> Immediate task creation."""
    # Given: Clear, simple voice command
    # When: Audio is processed
    # Then: Task is created with parsed time
```

#### 2. Complex Meeting Scheduling

```python
def test_complex_meeting_scheduling(self):
    """User: 'Schedule meeting with John and Sarah tomorrow at 2pm about project X'"""
    # Given: Complex multi-parameter command
    # When: Audio contains multiple entities
    # Then: All parameters are extracted and saved
```

#### 3. Unclear Request Handling

```python
def test_unclear_request_handling(self):
    """User: 'I need to call someone' -> Request clarification."""
    # Given: Ambiguous voice command
    # When: Required information is missing
    # Then: System asks for clarification
```

### Error Handling Scenarios

    # Given: Network connection is unstable
    # When: API calls fail
    # Then: Graceful fallback behavior
```

#### 2. Invalid Audio Format

```python
def test_invalid_audio_format(self):
    """Handle corrupted or unsupported audio data."""
    # Given: Invalid audio input
    # When: Speech recognition is attempted

```python
@pytest.mark.performance
def test_large_audio_files(self):
    """Process 10MB audio files efficiently."""
    # Given: Large audio input
    # When: Processing is attempted
    # Then: Memory usage is optimized
```

## 🔐 Security & Quality Assurance

### Security Testing

#### 1. Input Sanitization

```python
def test_input_sanitization(self):
    """Prevent injection attacks through voice input."""
    # Given: Malicious input in voice command
    # When: Input is processed
    # Then: Harmful content is sanitized
```

#### 2. Authentication Requirements

```python
def test_authentication_requirements(self):
    """Ensure voice commands require valid user session."""
    # Given: Unauthenticated request
    # When: Voice command is processed
    # Then: Authentication is enforced
```
